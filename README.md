## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The  follows a layered architecture that promotes separation of concerns and adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring that each layer has a specific responsibility. This architecture simplifies testing, maintenance, and scalability.

### Layers Overview

The **Blog API Project** follows a layered structure to enhance modularity and maintainability.

At its core, the **API layer** consists of controllers that handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate services. Controllers manage request validation and return structured HTTP responses to the client, acting as an entry point to the API.

The **Service layer** contains the core business logic of the application. It interacts with the repository layer through interfaces, adhering to SOLID principles. This design ensures that services can perform data operations (CRUD) using repositories and dependency injection is used here to manage dependencies on repositories.

The **Repository layer** manages data access and persistence. This layer isolates database operations in classes that interact directly with `BlogDbContext`, an Entity Framework Core context that maps `BlogPost` models to database tables. Implements the Repository Pattern to interact with the data layer. This layer isolates the direct database access and provides methods to query, add, update, and delete data, all through BlogDbContext using Entity Framework Core.

The **Data layer** is backed by an SQLite database, which stores blog post data in tables mapped to C# models via Entity Framework Core. This lightweight relational database serves as the persistent storage for the project.

Additionally, the **Model layer** defines the data structures used throughout the API, including validation attributes to enforce data integrity, while the **Utilities layer** includes logging and error-handling mechanisms (e.g., Serilog) to capture events and errors, supporting monitoring. Logging, error handling, and unit testing are included to enhance reliability, with Docker containerization as an optional feature to facilitate deployment.

## üß† Design Decisions

Throughout the development of the **Blog API Project**, several key design decisions were made to ensure maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices. Below are some of the main considerations:

### 1. Layered Architecture

A layered architecture was chosen to separate concerns and responsibilities across different layers:
   - **Controllers** handle request validation and response.
   - **Services** encapsulate the business logic and orchestrate data interactions.
   - **Repositories** manage data access, keeping data logic isolated from other parts of the application.
   - **Models** serve as data contracts, defining the structure and rules for each entity.

   This approach enables each layer to be independently tested, developed, and maintained, making the project more manageable.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

The project uses **Dependency Injection** extensively, allowing services and repositories to be injected where needed rather than being tightly coupled to any specific implementation. DI enhances testability and modularity, enabling easier swapping or modification of individual components.

### 3. Data Validation with Annotations

Data annotations were selected to enforce validation rules directly in the **Model** layer. This decision simplifies validation checks in the API, allowing automatic validation via attributes like `[Required]` and `[RegularExpression]` (for example, ensuring the `Author` name contains only letters).

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

To ensure robust error handling:
   - **Try-catch** blocks and specific error messages are used throughout service and repository layers.
   - **Serilog** was chosen for logging due to its structured logging capabilities, making it easier to track and monitor application events.
    - **Global Exception Handling** could also be added to further streamline error handling.
These practices enhance the reliability of the API, making it easier to identify and resolve issues in production environments.

### 5. Database Choice: SQLite

**SQLite** was chosen as the database for its lightweight and file-based nature, which simplifies local development and deployment in Docker. While SQLite is limited in scalability for high-traffic production use, it is ideal for the scope of this project and can be easily swapped out for a more robust DBMS if needed.

### 6. Docker for Deployment

Dockerization was implemented to make the API easy to deploy and run in isolated environments. This approach ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments, reducing issues related to configuration or environment setup.

### 7. Use of Swagger for API Documentation

**Swagger** was integrated for automatic API documentation. Swagger provides an interactive interface to test the API endpoints, which is valuable for both development and client testing.

## üõ°Ô∏è Validation, Error Handling, and Logging

This project incorporates comprehensive validation, error handling, and logging practices to ensure robust API functionality and maintain data integrity.

### 1. Validation

Data validation is enforced through **Data Annotations** in the model layer, which provide a simple yet effective way to validate user inputs:
   - **Required Attributes**: Key fields, such as `Title` and `Content`, are marked as required to prevent incomplete data entries.
   - **Custom Regular Expressions**: The `Author` field includes a regular expression check to ensure it contains only alphabetic characters and spaces, enforcing a standard format.
   - **Model State Validation**: Each controller action checks `ModelState.IsValid` to confirm that input data conforms to the specified validation rules. If validation fails, a `400 Bad Request` response with detailed validation errors is returned to the client.

### 2. Error Handling

Robust error handling is implemented throughout the project to manage unexpected situations and provide meaningful feedback to the client:
   - **Try-Catch Blocks**: Each service and repository method is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to capture any potential errors, particularly those related to database operations.
   - **Custom Error Messages**: Meaningful error messages are provided for specific scenarios, such as ‚ÄúPost not found‚Äù when attempting to update or delete a non-existent post.
   - **Global Exception Handling**: A global exception handler could be added to further streamline error handling, ensuring that any unhandled exceptions are logged and a generic error message is returned to the client.

### 3. Logging with Serilog

**Serilog** is integrated to provide structured and detailed logging throughout the API. This helps with tracking actions, diagnosing issues, and monitoring the application:
   - **Action Logging**: Key actions (e.g., creating, updating, and deleting blog posts) are logged with informative messages to track user interactions.
   - **Error Logging**: Errors caught in `catch` blocks are logged with stack traces to assist in diagnosing issues.
   - **Structured Logs**: Logs are structured to include relevant information (such as post IDs) to enhance readability and filter logs more easily.

With these measures in place, the API is well-equipped to handle user errors, unexpected issues, and critical application events, ensuring a high level of stability and reliability.
