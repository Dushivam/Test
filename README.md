## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The  follows a layered architecture that promotes separation of concerns and adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring that each layer has a specific responsibility. This architecture simplifies testing, maintenance, and scalability.

### Layers Overview

The **Blog API Project** follows a layered structure to enhance modularity and maintainability.

- At its core, the **API layer** consists of controllers that handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate services. Controllers manage request validation and return structured HTTP responses to the client, acting as an entry point to the API.

- The **Service layer** contains the core business logic of the application. It interacts with the repository layer through interfaces, adhering to SOLID principles. This design ensures that services can perform data operations (CRUD) using repositories and dependency injection is used here to manage dependencies on repositories.

- The **Repository layer** manages data access and persistence. This layer isolates database operations in classes that interact directly with `BlogDbContext`, an Entity Framework Core context that maps `BlogPost` models to database tables. Implements the Repository Pattern to interact with the data layer. This layer isolates the direct database access and provides methods to query, add, update, and delete data, all through BlogDbContext using Entity Framework Core.

- The **Data layer** is backed by an SQLite database, which stores blog post data in tables mapped to C# models via Entity Framework Core. This lightweight relational database serves as the persistent storage for the project.

- Additionally, the **Model layer** defines the data structures used throughout the API, including validation attributes to enforce data integrity, while the **Utilities layer** includes logging and error-handling mechanisms (e.g., Serilog) to capture events and errors, supporting monitoring. Logging, error handling, and unit testing are included to enhance reliability, with Docker containerization as an optional feature to facilitate deployment.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

The Blog API Project was designed with careful consideration of best practices and maintainability. Here are some key design decisions made to ensure that the API is robust, scalable, and user-friendly:

### 1. Layered Architecture

A layered architecture was chosen to separate responsibilities across different layers:
   - **Controllers** handle request validation and response.
   - **Services** encapsulate the business logic and manage data operations through repositories.
   - **Repositories** manage data access, keeping data logic isolated from other parts of the application.
   - **Models** serve as data templates, defining the structure and rules for each entity.
   - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** separate input/output models from the core domain models, adding a layer of abstraction for better API control.
      
This approach enables each layer to be independently tested, developed, and maintained, making the project more manageable.

### 2. Use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs were introduced to facilitate and secure data flow between the client and server:
   - **BlogPostCreateDto**: Used when creating a new blog post, this DTO includes only the fields necessary for creation, preventing unintended fields from being set.
   - **BlogPostUpdateDto**: Used to update an existing blog post, restricting updates only to the `Title`, `Content`, and `Author` fields, while preventing updates to fields like `Id` and `PublishedDate` to ensure data integrity.
   
![Test Results](images/CreateDTO.png)  ![Test Results](images/UpdateDTO.png) 

DTOs allows better control over which data is exposed to clients and what data clients can modify.

### 3. Restricted Updates on Certain Fields

Certain fields, such as `Id` and `PublishedDate`, are intentionally restricted in update operations:
   - **Id**: The primary identifier for each blog post, the `Id` field should remain unchanged to maintain database integrity and prevent issues with references.
   - **PublishedDate**: This field is intended to reflect the creation date and is automatically set during creation. Locking it prevents tampering and maintains the integrity of the timeline for posts.

Restricting updates on these fields helps maintain a consistent record of each blog post’s history and avoids unintended data modifications.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is used throughout the project to inject services and repositories where needed, rather than hard-coding dependencies:
   - **Advantages**: It enhances testability, modularity, and flexibility, allowing individual components to be modified without impacting the rest of the codebase.
   - **Implementation**: By registering dependencies in the `Program.cs` file, services and repositories are made available to the controllers and other layers, promoting loose coupling.

### 3. Data Validation with Annotations

Data annotations were selected to enforce validation rules directly in the **Model** layer. This decision simplifies validation checks in the API, allowing automatic validation via attributes like `[Required]` and `[RegularExpression]` (for example, ensuring the `Author` name contains only letters).

Data annotations in the **Model** and **DTO** layers enforce validation rules for each field:
   - **Required and MaxLength**: Ensures that fields like `Title` and `Content` meet specific length and existence requirements.
   - **Regular Expressions**: Enforces specific formats, such as restricting the `Author` field to only letters and spaces.

This approach simplifies validation within the API and prevents invalid data from entering the application, ensuring data integrity.

### 6. Structured Logging with Serilog

**Serilog** was chosen for logging due to its structured logging capabilities:
   - **Console and File Logging**: Logs are output to both the console and a file, providing both real-time information during development as well as persistent logs further diagnostics.
   - **Structured Data**: Logs are structured, meaning they capture additional context such as post IDs or error types, which facilitates easier filtering and tracking of application events.

Logging key actions and errors in this way provides valuable information for debugging and monitoring the API's performance.

### 7. Database Choice: SQLite

**SQLite** was chosen for its simplicity and portability:
   - **Lightweight**: SQLite is a file-based database that requires minimal setup, making it ideal for local development and smaller-scale applications.

While SQLite is limited in scalability for high-traffic production use, it is ideal for the scope of this project and can be easily swapped out for a more robust DBMS if needed.

### 6. Docker for Deployment

Dockerization was implemented to make the API easy to deploy and run in isolated environments. This approach ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments, reducing issues related to configuration or environment setup.

### 9. Use of Swagger for API Documentation

**Swagger** was integrated to auto-generate API documentation and provide an interactive interface.
   - **API Exploration**: The Swagger UI allows developers to explore API endpoints and understand their functionality. They can also test the available endpoints, input data, and view responses without needing separate documentation.

Swagger’s interactive documentation makes it easier for both developers to test and understand the API.

## 🛡️ Validation, Error Handling, and Logging

This project incorporates comprehensive validation, error handling, and logging practices to ensure robust API functionality and maintain data integrity.

### 1. Validation

Data validation is enforced through **Data Annotations** in the model layer.
   - **Required Attributes**: Key fields, such as `Id`, `Title` and `Content`, are mandatory.
   - **Custom Regular Expressions**: The `Author` field includes a regular expression check to ensure it contains only alphabetic characters and spaces.
   - **Model State Validation**: The controller checks ModelState.IsValid; if validation fails, a 400 Bad Request response with error details is returned.

![Model](images/Model.png)

### 2. Error Handling

Error handling is implemented to manage unexpected issues and provide clear feedback to the client:
   - **Try-Catch Blocks**: Each service and repository method is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to capture any potential errors, particularly those related to database operations.
   - **Custom Error Messages**: Meaningful error messages, such as “Post not found” are provided for relevent scenarios.

### 3. Logging with Serilog

**Serilog** is integrated to provide structured and detailed logging throughout the API. This helps with tracking actions, diagnosing issues, and monitoring the application:
   - **Action Logging**: Key actions (e.g., creating, updating, and deleting blog posts) are logged with informative messages to track user interactions.
   - **Error Logging**: Errors caught in `catch` blocks are logged with stack traces to assist in diagnosing issues.
   - **Structured Logs**: Logs are structured to include relevant information (such as post IDs) to enhance readability and filter logs more easily.

With these measures, the API is equipped to handle user errors, unexpected issues, and critical application events, ensuring a high level of stability and reliability.
